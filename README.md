# unicrypto

uniCrypto parses files (or folders, recursively) for cryptocurrency addresses. Parsed addresses are submitted to a crypto API which returns basic information such as current balance and transactional information, which is then compiled with other metadata into a JSON file saved at the root of the target directory (unless another output location is specified).
